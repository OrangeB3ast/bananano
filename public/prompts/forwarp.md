Excellent! This is very revealing. Looking at the logs and the curl test results, I can see several important things:

The application is running and responding correctly - The curl localhost:3000 command returned a proper HTML response, which means the app is listening and working inside the container.
Looking at the logs, I can see:

The server is running ("server running")
It's serving initial configuration
There are HTTP access logs showing requests being handled
It's listening on localhost:3000 ("host":"localhost:3000")


The key issue I can spot: In the logs, I see "host":"localhost:3000" - this suggests the application might be binding to localhost instead of 0.0.0.0.
The HTML response shows: This appears to be "Bananano Studios - AI Movie Poster Generator" - a React/frontend application.

Since the curl localhost:3000 works inside the container, but the external domain bananano.juicyflux.com doesn't work, this confirms the issue is with the network binding or proxy routing.
Looking more closely at the logs, I can see what appears to be Caddy server logs (I see "caddy" and "tls" references). This means the application might be using Caddy as a web server.
The fact that curl localhost:3000 works means the app is running, but the Traefik proxy (Coolify's reverse proxy) can't reach it because it's only listening on localhost, not on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
For a containerized application to be accessible via Coolify's reverse proxy, it needs to listen on 0.0.0.0:3000, not localhost:3000.

Great news! Your app IS running and working inside the container. The curl localhost:3000 shows it's serving your "Bananano Studios - AI Movie Poster Generator" correctly.
The Problem: Your app is binding to localhost:3000 instead of 0.0.0.0:3000. I can see this in your logs:
"host":"localhost:3000"
Why This Breaks External Access:

✅ Inside container: localhost:3000 works
❌ From Coolify proxy: Can't reach localhost:3000 (only sees it as external traffic)

The Fix:
Your application needs to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just localhost.
How to Fix It:

If this is a Node.js/Express app, change your server code from:
javascriptapp.listen(3000, 'localhost')  // ❌
to:
javascriptapp.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0')    // ✅

If using Caddy server (which I see in your logs), make sure your Caddyfile has:
:3000 {
    # your config
}
NOT localhost:3000
After making the change:

Redeploy your app (click "Redeploy" button)
Or restart the container



Once your app binds to 0.0.0.0:3000, Coolify's proxy will be able to reach it and bananano.juicyflux.com will work!
What needs to change in your code?

* what do I need to do, write precise command / custom instruction for my AI agent - i will delete colify project and will start over.Edit <contemplator>
The user wants to fix the localhost binding issue in their project code, then redeploy it through the Git → Coolify workflow. They want precise commands/instructions they can give to their AI agent to make the necessary code changes.
From what I can see:

This appears to be a React/frontend application called "Bananano Studios - AI Movie Poster Generator"
It's using Caddy server (based on the logs showing Caddy)
The issue is that the server is binding to localhost:3000 instead of 0.0.0.0:3000
They want to start over with Coolify deployment after fixing the code

I need to provide specific instructions for:

Finding and fixing the server binding configuration
The exact code changes needed
Commands to commit and push the changes
Brief reminder of the Coolify redeployment process

Since this appears to be using Caddy (based on the logs), the fix will likely be in a Caddyfile or server configuration file. But it could also be a Node.js server file if they're running a custom server.
I should give comprehensive instructions that cover the most likely scenarios.

Precise Instructions for Your AI Agent:
Fix Server Binding Issue
Task: Change server binding from localhost to 0.0.0.0 to make it accessible from external traffic.
Check these files in your project and make these exact changes:
1. If you have a Caddyfile:
# FIND this (or similar):
localhost:3000 {
    # config...
}

# REPLACE with:
:3000 {
    # config...
}
2. If you have server.js or app.js or index.js:
javascript// FIND this pattern:
app.listen(3000, 'localhost')
// OR
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, 'localhost')
// OR
server.listen(3000, 'localhost')

// REPLACE with:
app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0')
// OR
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, '0.0.0.0')
// OR
server.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0')
3. If you have package.json scripts:
json// FIND:
"start": "some-server --host localhost"
// REPLACE with:
"start": "some-server --host 0.0.0.0"
4. If you have Docker setup:
Check Dockerfile for any --host localhost flags and change to --host 0.0.0.0
Commands to Run After Changes:
bash# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: change server binding from localhost to 0.0.0.0 for container access"
git push origin main
Coolify Redeployment:

Delete current Coolify project
Create new project pointing to your git repo
Use same domain: bananano.juicyflux.com
Deploy - should work now

Search these exact terms in your codebase: localhost:3000, 127.0.0.1:3000, host: 'localhost', --host localhost
